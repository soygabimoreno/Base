### Collaborate
I am [Gabi Moreno](https://gabimoreno.soy).

This is an open source project. Feel free to request **[issues](https://github.com/soygabimoreno/Base/issues)**.

And for sure, **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/soygabimoreno/Base/pulls)** are opened and super-well received.

#### Configuration
Take into account you should add something like this in your `local.properties` to build the
project:

```
CLARITY_PROJECT_ID=foo
MASTER_KEY=foo
keystore.keyAlias=foo
keystore.storeFile=foo
keystore.storePassword=foo
keystore.keyPassword=foo
```

## Building with Gradle

From the repository root run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

This compiles all modules. You can build a specific sample app by
providing its Gradle path, for example `:gabimoreno` or `:bike`.

### Running sample apps

Deploy the debug build of a module to a connected device or emulator:

```bash
./gradlew :gabimoreno:installDebug   # Los androides
./gradlew :bike:installDebug         # Bike demo
```

### Running unit tests

Execute all unit tests across the project with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

You can run tests for a single module using its path, e.g.
`./gradlew :modules:core:test`.
